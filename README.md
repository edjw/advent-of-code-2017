# Advent of Code 2017

My work on the [Advent of Code 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017). I don't think code quality will be all that great!

## Day 1
[Part One](https://github.com/edjw/advent-of-code-2017/blob/master/one_one.py)

[Part Two](https://github.com/edjw/advent-of-code-2017/blob/master/one_two.py)

...Review a sequence of digits (your puzzle input) and find the sum of all digits that match the next digit in the list. The list is circular, so the digit after the last digit is the first digit in the list.

For example:

1122 produces a sum of 3 (1 + 2) because the first digit (1) matches the second digit and the third digit (2) matches the fourth digit.

1111 produces 4 because each digit (all 1) matches the next.

1234 produces 0 because no digit matches the next.

91212129 produces 9 because the only digit that matches the next one is the last digit, 9.

What is the solution to your captcha?

The spreadsheet consists of rows of apparently-random numbers. To make sure the recovery process is on the right track, they need you to calculate the spreadsheet's checksum. For each row, determine the difference between the largest value and the smallest value; the checksum is the sum of all of these differences.

For example, given the following spreadsheet:

5 1 9 5
7 5 3
2 4 6 8

The first row's largest and smallest values are 9 and 1, and their difference is 8.

The second row's largest and smallest values are 7 and 3, and their difference is 4.

The third row's difference is 6.

In this example, the spreadsheet's checksum would be 8 + 4 + 6 = 18.

What is the checksum for the spreadsheet in your puzzle input?
